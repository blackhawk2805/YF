This is a Yahoo Finance Options Data Scraper Tool, which help you get the options data of all US stocks, all you need to do is to type the ticker name of the listed company whose data you want to fetch. 
Step by step :- 
Copy the code
Step 1 : Paste it in any type of script editor ( python )
Step 2 : Run the import codes. 
Step 3 : Run the code below it 
Step 4 : Run final "Get Options" code. 
You can alter the data whichever way you'd like to be represented, so help youself and make the whichever changes you'd like. 
Also would love to get a feedback on it if I could extend it more and use it and if I could learn something new.
